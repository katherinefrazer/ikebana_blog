Recently the deYoung had their annual [Bouquets to Art exhibition](https://deyoung.famsf.org/bouquets-to-art). The gist is that floral artists in the Bay Area (and I think abroad as well?) are encouraged to pick a piece from the deYoung’s permanent collection that speaks to them. Then, they make a floral arrangement that is inspired by the piece. The floral arrangement and the artwork sit next to each other for a week. It’s the deYoung’s blockbuster event, drawing crazy crowds every year.

Unsurprisingly, their programming moved online this year, which allowed me to peruse some names and images I wouldn’t have come across in an in-person exhibition. Here, I discovered Soho Sakai!

Soho Sakai has been teaching ikebana in the bay area [since 1997](https://www.sogetsu-sohostudygroup.org/about-us-soho-study-group-ssg/). She runs the bay area chapter of Sogetsu Ikebana, and teaches my own ikebana teacher!

Her work is incredible. I thought I’d share a small set of images I found online. Perhaps I’ll find more ikebana artists and share their work through this blog, while my own studies are on hiatus?
