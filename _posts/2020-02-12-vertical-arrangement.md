![A vertical arrangement](/assets/2020-01-25/vertical_arrangement.png)

The first theme of the level three curriculum arrangement is “vertical composition”.

My textbook reads,
> Everything begins with looking at the materials carefully. Be conscious of the beauty of the natural lines which the plants originally have and their power which reaches upwards.
>
> There is no rule as to the ratio between vertical length and the horizontal width for this arrangement, as long as it has an overall vertical composition. In this lesson, make an arrangement in *Moribana*. The composition needs to express the power of the plants’ upward thrust.
>
> What is important here is to be free of fixed styles of *Kakeiho*. Develop your ideas of what and how you want to arrange, and try to make an arrangement based on these ideas.
>
> The plants do not necessarily have to stand upright. Be sure to finish the base part neatly so that the *Kenzans* are not shown.
