![An ikebana arrangement made up of two vases](/assets/two-vases.jpeg)

Today I made an arrangement that required using two vases. I picked up this nice pair at the San Francisco Flower Mart. I like the organic structure and lifelike quality to the slump!

I decided to use the smaller vase more minimally. This feels like the first arrangement Iâ€™ve made where I try to make the flowers more expressive than what they really are.
