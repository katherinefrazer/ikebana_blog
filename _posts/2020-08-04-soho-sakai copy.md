![A floral arrangement made up of three orange dahlias, in a rectangular vase. The vase has a circular hole in the middle, where one dahlia is coming out. The top of the vase dips down, holding two other dahlias.](/assets/2020-08-08/dahlia_freestyle.png)

My ikebana teacher surprised me with some flowers. I made this simple freestyle arrangement with them. I hope you enjoy!
